These screenshots are all what I'm able to find online currently. A lot of my
screenshots posted online have "expired" by the host, expect fresh screenshots
at some point in the future.

## jp_diner_port

This was a level based on [JP's Diner](http://kylexy.wikia.com/wiki/JP's_Diner)
from the TV show [Kyle XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_XY). Orginally
made to look exactly like the reference images for Half-Life 2. Later ported to
the Left 4 Dead 2 engine with plans to become a full campaign.

## Temple of Horus

Made as part of a project for a high school history class and later expanded
to be a more functional map. Never settled on a game to develop it for.

## Hallway of Architecture submission

Thread seems to have disappeared from the internet. The idea was to have a map
of connected hallways each displaying a unique and interesting form of
architecture.
