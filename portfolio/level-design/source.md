These screenshots are all what I'm able to find online currently. A lot of my
screenshots posted online have "expired" by the host, expect fresh screenshots
at some point in the future.

## jp_diner_port

![diner](/img/level-design/source/slider_jps_diner.png)

This was a level based on [JP's Diner](http://kylexy.wikia.com/wiki/JP's_Diner)
from the TV show [Kyle XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_XY). Orginally
made to look exactly like the reference images for Half-Life 2. Later ported to
the Left 4 Dead 2 engine with plans to become a full campaign. This was one of
the earliest maps I worked on and I learned a lot in the process. This map
includes a number of custom props and textures (made in Maya and Photoshop)
and taught me plenty about visleaf optimization.

## Temple of Horus

![temple-of-horus](/img/level-design/source/slider_temple_of_horus.png)

Made as part of a project for a high school history class and later expanded
to be a more functional map. Never settled on a game to develop it for.

## Hallway of Architecture submission

Thread seems to have disappeared from the internet. The idea was to have a map
of connected hallways each displaying a unique and interesting form of
architecture. This was my submission for one segment of the hallway. My
section includes several custom props and textures, and some very intricate
(but still valid and on the grid) brushwork.
