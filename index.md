Hey there, I'm a computer scientist and game developer with a passion for
virtual reality. I love learning, rapid prototyping, and finding creative
solutions to hard problems.

I am a Senior Research Specialist at [CISL](http://cisl.rpi.edu/), a research
lab that is a collaboration between RPI and IBM. We focus primarily on
creating experiences that are both cognitive and immersive, using Watson APIs
and the wonderful facilities at [EMPAC](http://empac.rpi.edu/).

Previously, I was a cofounder and the CTO of [Ilium VR](https://iliumvr.com/),
a startup building realistic rifles for immersive VR first person shooter
games. As part of Ilium VR, I was a
[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) fellow in the F2 batch. 

During my time at [RPI](http://rpi.edu/), I was a coordinator and mentor for
the [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io/) and a founder and
organizer of [HackRPI](https://hackrpi.com/).

I am also the author and maintainer of two popular open-source C# libraries,
[SharpFont](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont) and
[SharpNav](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpNav).

This website was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). It is being
hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) currently.
