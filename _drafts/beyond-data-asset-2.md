One of the big benefits to setting up your own custom asset type is the ability
to import and export instances of your asset. If you are working with external
software, this is the most natural way to interface it with Unreal. This can
also be the gateway into deeper Excel integrations.

In part 1, we looked at how to set up a "target practice" asset from scratch,
without the boilerplate provided by DataAsset. Now we will be looking at
reading and writing them from an external file.

# Class Setup

# File Format

# Importer

## Reimport Handling

# Exporter

Check in later for part 3, where we build out a custom AssetEditor
