A custom AssetEditor can make all the difference in how your systems are
structured. Knowing that complex asset types can be edited reasonably on
their own makes assets a viable strategy in more cases. 

In part 2, we looked at importing and exporting assets from external files,
allowing asset data to be edited outside the engine. In this part, we will
be building our own in-engine editor for complex data in an asset.

# AssetEditor Classes

Before framing out all of the classes, it is important to understand the
relationship between all of them.

# Basic Editor

TODO Code to show a basic editor with just the details panel

# Adding a Viewport

TODO add viewport, modify layout
