Small update, I made a YouTube video showing off the ability to keep assets
in-game updated with their version on the filesystem. I decided to verbally
explain the changes as I made them similar to how Wolfire makes their update
videos for Overgrowth. I got a lot of positive feedback about it, so I'm
probably going to continue this style of video for all future updates.
