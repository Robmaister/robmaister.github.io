It's been pretty quiet here lately...

I thought I'd get the ball rolling again by posting a little tool I've been
working on for a while. I've used this tool as a means to learn a bit more
about .NET and C# in general, otherwise I could have whipped this up in a
matter of a day or two. There will be far more coming as well, and eventually
a full Far Cry 2 model/texture pack, most likely for the Source Engine/GMod.

So without further ado, here's a zip containing both the GUI and command line
versions. Please report any bugs.

(**Temporarily just a Github link while I find the original .zip**)
