    alt: VR for G3
---

I recently received a "VR for G3" headset from LG as part of a [Facebook
promotion][1], which is awesome given that my current phone is the [LG G3][2].

It eventually came in the mail and I immediately opened it up and gave it a
shot. My first impression was that this was going to be awesome, but in it's
current form, a little less than ok. The G3 has a Quad HD (2560x1440)
resolution, which means the [screen-door effect][3] is negligible, especially
with the low field of view you get with the Google Cardboard lenses. The
experience, however, was hindered by the construction of the headset itself.
The main issues I had with it were:

  - Tiny nose hole
  - No head straps (though they left 2 holes for them)
  - Lots of light leakage
  - Hard plastic edges pressing against your face
  - magnetic button doesn't seem to work as well as an actual Cardboard
  
Most of these problems can be solved with a little bit of work, and since I'd
really like to have an untethered VR headset, I decided to put in the effort
to fix it up.

# Materials

![Materials][4]

Your local fabric or crafts store should have everything you need. Here are
the supplies you will need:

|--------------------------------------------+--------|
| Item                                       |  Cost  |
|:-------------------------------------------|-------:|
| VR for G3 headset                          |  $0.00 |
| 3/4" Elastic - Dritz 9306B (1" also works) |  $4.85 |
| Strap Adjuster - Dritz 477                 |  $1.99 |
| Regular-Density Foam                       |  $5.99 |
|============================================|========|
| Total                                      | $12.83 |
{: .data-table}

I also used the following tools in the process that I didn't have to buy:

  - Thread (black or white works well if you care about color)
  - Needle
  - Dremel
  - Round file
  - Low-grit sandpaper (I used 100)
  - Knife
  - Scissors
  - Hot glue gun
  
You should be able to find substitutes for most of these things if you don't
have them lying around and can't borrow them from a friend. I just used what I
had around and borrowed a friend's Dremel. Whatever gets the job done!

# Procedure

![elastic strap][5]

Start by cutting a piece of elastic to length. I put my headset on and
measured the elastic from the left strap hole to about the back of my head
and made a cut there.
    
 - ![thread and needle][6]
 - ![sewing][7]
 {: .img-grid}
    
Thread the needle and start sewing the elastic on the headset like the picture
above. If you don't know how to sew, there are some great tutorials and videos
online for beginners. I used a cross stitch, but a running stitch would work
just fine.
    
    
 - ![adjuster left][8]
 - ![left sew][9]
 {: .img-grid}

Grab one of the strap adjusters and loop the elastic around it like the
picture above. The instructions for my strap adjusters recommend stitching an
X in the middle of the square, so I did just that. I used a running stitch
here since I was running low on black thread.
    
![right strap][10]

Measure out another length of elastic, this time from the right strap hole all
the way to the back of the head and a little further, for adjustment. Then sew
it to the headset like before. This time I ran out of black thread, so it's
white on this half.
    
 - ![adjuster right][11]
 - ![seal it off][12]
 {: .img-grid}

Loop this piece through the strap adjuster like the picture above and sew it
after folding it over itself. **I would recommend actually folding it over
twice**, since the tab I made can actually slip through the adjuster without
too much trouble. This is something I'm planning on fixing later.

 - ![dremel start][13]
 - ![filed down][14]
 {: .img-grid}

Grab your Dremel (or other rotary tool) and start cutting away at the nose
hole. For me this was a long process of cutting part of it away, trying it on,
seeing what needed more cutting, and repeating. Once you get it down to size
use a round file to smooth it out.

![dremel other parts][15]

Dremel the other two pieces of your headset as well. Follow the same process
as before until the whole headset feels good on your face. Then file all of
it down and finish by sanding everything you cut to give you nice, smooth
edges.
    
 - ![cut foam][16]
 - ![put groove in foam][17]
 {: .img-grid}

Cut out a small piece of foam. I ended up using only half the amount of foam
as I cut out in the picture. Cut pieces to size and create a groove in the
middle to make it easier to glue on. I started with a knife and quickly
realized that scissors worked way better for everything but the groove. With a
well sized groove, the foam should stay on the headset without glue unless
upside down.

![assemble and glue][18]

Take your foam pieces and assemble them. Apply some hot glue to the plastic
edge of the headset and put the foam pieces in so that the inside of the
groove is glued to the plastic. It doesn't have to look great as long as
feels comfortable and blocks all the ambient light behind you.
    
# Result

![the final product][19]

Here it is! Finally assembled and ready to go. This headset now provides a
comfortable, hands-free experience.

I've found that most demos actually have a pretty large amount of latency on
my phone, probably the result of decent hardware with a massive screen. Still,
the benefit of this over a Rift is that I'm untethered.

Earlier today I used this headset as part of my research with RPI's
[Emergent Reality Lab][20] to create a "room scale" Google Cardboard
experience. The ability to walk around a space with accurate position tracking
was amazing, and even with a small amount of latency, I had no difficulty or
nausea from walking around, crouching, leaning, etc.

I will update this post with a video of myself using this headset in our CAVE
shortly.

# Remaining Issues

![scratches][21]

  - While I was sanding down the nose hole, I accidentally got a few scratches
    into one of the lenses. Going to try and fix this with toothpaste or
    baking soda.
  - The headset breaks apart when putting the headset on as well as with
    sudden movements like jumping. I'm going to find a clamp to keep it all
    together once the phone is in so I don't keep dropping my phone.
  - Still some minor light leakage from the sides. Need to replace or add to
    the foam on the left and right edges to get rid of it.
