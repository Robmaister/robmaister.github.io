The following post will be a guide on how to open up an Asus EeePC 1005HA and
replace the Wifi card if you need something that's more supported for
something or if you want one with a specific feature or for any reason,
really. So to begin, all you need is a philips head screwdriver and a few
minutes of your time. My Wifi card of choice is a [Dell 1510][1], but you can
swap it out with any other PCI-e half-height mini card.

**WARNING: I am not responsible for any damage done to you, others, your
netbook, or any other object that may be affected by the use of these
instructions.**

*NOTE:* Before you start taking apart the computer, I recommend you **boot to
the BIOS (press F2 on startup) and disable the internal WLAN**. I'm not sure
if it really changes anything or not, but there really isn't a reason not to,
it takes all of 10 seconds.

![Setting up][2]
Ok. First things first, remove the battery and unplug the laptop from
everything. We want to swap the card while the computer is off. Start by
turning the computer over and unscrewing the 4 screws on the corners of the
netbook as well as the screw holding the RAM port in. There should be one
silver screw on the bottom of the RAM area, unscrew this too.

![Removing the keyboard][3]
Next, we will flip the computer up and open the lid. We need to remove the
keyboard. On the top part of the keyboard, just after the Fn keys, there will
be 4 tabs holding the keyboard down. Start from the left, push the first one
out towards the monitor and pull up on the Esc key. If you do it right, the
keyboard should lift slightly as seen in the picture. Push the rest of the
tabs out and the keyboard should lift more and more.

![Slab of Glue][4]
The only challenge with lifting the keyboard the entire way out is a small
slab of glue on the right. Don't try to keep lifting from the Esc key, that
will bend the keyboard. Instead, push up slightly from the closest Fn key you
can. Keep applying a little pressure until the keyboard separates from the
glue. It will eventually come off.

![Keyboard connection][5]
The keyboard should have one wire connected to the motherboard below it. There
should be two black tabs, push them out with either your fingers or a flat
object like a flathead screwdriver or a butter knife. After you push the tabs
out, the connection should be freed and you can put the keyboard aside.

![Internal Screws][6]
From here you should be able to see another 6 screws (one under the warranty
warning). In case you can't see them, I've pointed them out in the picture.
Unscrew all of them. I don't think the screws are any different than the
exterior ones, but I separated them anyway.

![Removing the top of the netbook][7]
The absolute hardest part of this process is taking the top part of the
netbook off of the bottom part. You simply have to apply some force and push
it up and off. Start with the top right and work to the bottom right, then the
top left to the bottom left. To get the top line off, tilt your monitor lid in
just a little and flip it over to the bottom. There will be 3 tabs that need
to be pushed out in order to release the top part.&nbsp; From there, the
bottom section should snap right off.

![The Wifi card][8]
Don't bother with removing the connection between the top part and the
motherboard, just lay it down in front of the netbook. From here, the wifi
card should be easily located. It's towards the bottom center, and it has a
gold antenna attached to it. Carefully pry the antenna off and leave it
hanging for now. There will be one small sliver screw. Unscrew it and place it
aside. The wifi card should simply pop up and out. Now just do the reverse to
get the new card in: insert card, push down, screw in silver screw, attach
antenna to either location.

Before you try and put it all back together, gently press the power button and
boot up, double check that it does indeed work. If you disabled Wifi in the
BIOS at the beginning of this guide, you should now boot back into the BIOS
and turn it back on. Now all you have to do is follow this guide backwards
(not including this last step with the wifi card) to put it back together.

![It works!][9]
