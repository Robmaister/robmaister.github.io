Fairly content-less post, but whatever. I'm done with school for the next few
months. Here's what you can expect in that time:

 - Hackintoshed netbook, and getting several different things to work with it.
 - A ton more mapping updates, I'll post these regularly.
 - Softmodded Xbox (original) and getting that working.
 - Potentially some iDroid stuff, once planetbe1ng gets power management working.
 - Programming, possibly some SFML programs, I'm starting to learn SFML.
 - Unboxings of random things I get, possibly some reviews on them.
 - Other awesome stuff I feel like sharing with teh internets.

I'll keep you guys updated!
