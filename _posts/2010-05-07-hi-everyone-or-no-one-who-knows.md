I thought I might as well make a blog with everything I've been doing
recently. I'm probably going to stop posting mapping updates on Facebook and
link to this blog every major map update, and I'm probably going to start
posting more and more updates, and include some of my programming work here
too.

To start off this blog, I have two of [these bad boys][1] en route to my house
via UPS. I'll unbox them and post pictures here.

**UPDATE:**

The monitors arrived, these things are AMAZING! Having two of them actually
helps quite a bit. You can have a reference image on one monitor and Maya on
the other. No dead pixels, set it up in only a few minutes, and the pixel
aspect ratio is perfect. I couldn't have asked for more.
