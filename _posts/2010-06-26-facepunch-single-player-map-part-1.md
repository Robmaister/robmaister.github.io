About a week ago, the [Facepunch Single Player Mapping Competition][1]
started. It's going to go on until August 14th, 11:59PM GMT. I have the
general layout put up on my whiteboard, and I'm adding most of the
unimportant details as I go along. So far, I just have the intro done along
with the first gate puzzle. I've added a lot more since I recorded the video,
I suggest you keep up with the Facepunch thread, as I'll probably only be
putting the videos I upload to youtube on my blog.
