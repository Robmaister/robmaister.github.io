Last friday night I noticed I was starting to lose motivation in the larger
projects I was working on, and I wanted to challenge myself a bit, so I
decided to give myself about 5 hours to make a clone of minesweeper, with my
own art and all. I decided to record the whole thing with hypercam as a
timelapse. I successfully completed the project within 5 hours, and the
timelapse is now available on YouTube:

I'm also open-sourcing the project under the zlib license, hopefully it will
be useful to someone out there. Using Mono, this game can run on almost any
platform, but I've only tested it on Windows 7 x64 and Arch Linux x64.

Requires the .NET Framework 2.0 (or Mono 1.2).
