So this last Thursday was portfolio night. Over the past week, I've put
several hours of work into the display. Not that awesome by my standards
(mapping album on facebook, other projects), but that doesn't matter,  it was
still considered impressive to most of the people there. This was the reason I
probably got two night's worth of sleep over a week. There  isn't much more to
say, so without further ado, a screenshot of said display:
