I'm working on a new project with a whole bunch of friends and I just tried
implementing multitexturing for the terrain. When I first tested it, I had the
texture weight values incorrectly calculated so that only the bottom third had
positive values and it looked pretty cool so I snapped some screenshots of it.
I'm not sure why everything above the textured areas are blue, but I'm
guessing it has to do with transparency and the background color.
