Circuit Crawler is now on the Android market! 100% of all proceeds will go to
the [Youth for Technology Foundation][2] to help children in Africa and the
poorest parts of America get access to the technology that most of us take for
granted.

I've been working on this game since around November with 4 of my friends. I'm
very excited to have this game completed and on the market. New Years
resolution #1 completed!
